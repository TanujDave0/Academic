--Tanuj Dave--

Files:
-project.ipynb
-breast-cancer-wisconsin.data
-breast-cancer-wisconsin-original.data

the folder includes the python notebook with the code to train and test
the data using Gaussian Naive Bayes approach.

The libraries required are:
-numpy
-pandas
-matplotlib
-sklearn
-statistics

The files mentioned need to be in the same folder to run properly.

No APIs were used. Code can be run directly using the python notebook
to show the results.
