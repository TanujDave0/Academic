DISCLAIMER: This live coding prompt is purposely ambiguous.  We arenâ€™t going to tell you exactly how to cout, exactly how to handle edge cases, etc.  There is no autograder and auto grading would defeat the purpose of the exercise.  Instead, you should talk through all of your thoughts and state any assumptions as you are solving the problem.  

You got this.  :D  

PROMPT:

**********************
About - The file contains the closing prices of the Dow Jones stock market index over the last 30 years. The first row in the text file contains the column headers 
for "Year" and "Price". Each remaining row contains an integer year followed by the closing price (double) for that year. The values are separated by a space. As you work 
through the problem state any assumptions.

File reading - read the data in. Store the file headers as string variables and store the remaining rows in a map with the year as the key and the price as the value.

Process/Calculations
1. Output the average Price over the 30 years.
2. Output the year that had the largest increase in price from the previous year.

Creative component - create one cin and one cout for this problem.  Make sure your code uses the cin.

Good luck!
