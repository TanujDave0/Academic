For ourvector<States>:
    Number of vectors created: 1, This was created in line 374 inside main to
                               store all the states as struct objects.
        
    Number of elements inserted: 50, this is the number of states in the file
                                 and added to the vector. 
                                 
    Number of elemets accessed: 1353, for storing the data loaded from voters file
                                I used a linear search function (binary search and selection
                                sort increased accesses) to search for the states. Thus it
                                took 1325 accesses for searching states to store eligible
                                voters and 28 accesses more to search for Illinois since it
                                is at 28th position.
        
    
For ourvector<int>:
    Number of vectors created: 1, only one state was searched (Illinois). This would be the 
                               number of states searched for using search command. Line 373
        
    Number of elements inserted: 54, since Illinois has 18 districts, and each state requires 
                                 3 elements (percentage of democratic votes, democratic votes,
                                 and republican votes), thus 18*3 = 54.
        
    Number of elemets accessed: 90, since for each district, 'stats' function has 2 accesses,
                                'plot' has 1 access, and winnable has 2 accesses, thus 5
                                accesses total for each district, 18*5 = 90.
