I consider offsence involving children to be serious and deceptive practicing to be of a lesser importance.
While creating the map for Predictive Policing, I gave twice as much importance to offense involving children than Deceptive Practicing.
So, the appropriate ratio that would add upto 1 would be 0.333 and 0.666.
Thus, I arrived at 0.34 and 0.66 ratio for deceptive practicing to offense involving children.
