## Question 1: Largest approximate y value
# Answer: writing max(yvals1) outputs 0.3989423, 0.4 is
#         the approximate largest y value in the standard
#         normal density function
## Question 2: Describe the Standard Normal Density Function
# Answer: The standard normal distribution is symmetric,
#           and it is bell shaped
## Question 3: x-values
# Do they stop?
#yes
# Reason:
# typing xvals1 in console to check the x values contained in it
# shows that they start and stop at exactly -3.35 and 3.35.
# If they don't stop, what do they go to?
## Question 4: Based on graph in Part 1, what do the x-values represent?
# Answer: the x values depict values the random variable say X
#           takes in a standard normal distribution with mean=0
#           and sd = 1
## Question 5: What do the y-values approach as x goes to +/- infinity?
# As x goes towards -infinity: y -> 0
# As x goes towards +infinity: y -> 1
## Question 6: What do the overlaid lines represent where they intersect the CDF?
# Horizontal lines: the horizontal line represent the  y values or the cumulative probabilities
#                     for the corresponding point on the cdf line plotted where they intersect.
# Vertical lines: represent the x vlaues or the values the random normal variable value
#                   for the corresponding points they intersect on.
## Question 7: Using the Normal CDF curve, identify the value.
# Answer: the first vertical line represents the value x = 416.6806
#           thus the vertical line it corresponds to is the line it intersects
#           when it intersects the main cdf plot, thus the first horizontal line.
#           which corresponds to 0.025 (first value in cumul_pbty).
