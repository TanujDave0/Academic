## Task 4: Histogram for Students Passing Algebra
## Remember to save your plot and also submit it to Gradescope.
# Code:
hist(spa,right = FALSE,
ylim = c(0,25),
breaks = seq(0,120,10))
# Describe histogram: symmetry?
# The histogram is not symmetric and has 3 peaks
# Describe histogram: unimodal or bimodal or multimodal?
# the histogram is multimodal with 3 peaks/humps
## Task 5: Histogram for Graduation Rate
## Remember to save your plot and also submit it to Gradescope.
# Code:
hist(gr,
right = FALSE,
ylim = c(0,20),
breaks = seq(0,100,10))
# Describe histogram: symmetry?
# The histogram has a relatively symmetric plot.
# Describe histogram: unimodal or bimodal or multimodal?
# the histogram is unimodal.
## Task 6: Boxplot for Students Passing Algebra
## Remember to save your plot and also submit it to Gradescope.
# Code:
ba <- boxplot(spa,horizontal = TRUE)
# Are there outliers present? No, there are no outliers
oalg <- ba$out
oalg
## Task 7: Boxplot for Graduation Rate
## Remember to save your plot and also submit it to Gradescope.
# Code:
brate <- boxplot(gr,horizontal = TRUE)
# Are there outliers present? No, there are no outliers
or <- brate$out
## Task 8: Shapiro-Wilk Test for Students Passing Algebra
# Code:
shapiro.test(spa)
# Copy and paste results here
#		Shapiro-Wilk normality test
#
#		data:  students_passing_algebra
#		W = 0.97738, p-value = 0.02852
# Do you think that your population is normally distributed?
# No
# Reason:
# the p value is too little than 0.05
# Does your decision here match what you are seeing with your histogram from Task 4? Why or why not?
# Yes, the histogram did not have a normal distribution either.
## Task 9: Shapiro-Wilk Test for Graduation Rate
# Code:
shapiro.test(graduation_rate)
# Copy and paste results here
#Shapiro-Wilk normality test
#data:  graduation_rate
#W = 0.9884, p-value = 0.7067
# Do you think that your population is normally distributed?
# Yes,
# Reason: It has a high pvalue greater than 0.05
# Does your decision here match what you are seeing with your histogram from Task 5? Why or why not?
# The histogram was approximately normal and the test verifies the result.
## Task 10: Compare average PLAN scores from students tested Fall 2009 to the average PLAN scores from students tested Fall 2010.  Create a confidence interval, assuming equal variances. (See PDF for CI to create.)
# Code:
t.test(gp2009, gp2009, alternative = "two.sided",conf.level = 0.914 ,var.equal = TRUE)
# Copy and paste results here
#  Two Sample t-test
#  data:  grade_plane_2009 and grade_plane_2010
# t = 0.21531, df = 167, p-value = 0.8298
#  alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
#  91.4 percent confidence interval:
#    -0.5432962  0.6980481
#  sample estimates:
#    mean of x mean of y
#  15.14634  15.06897
# State the parameter the confidence interval is for.
# THe test is for the difference of means.
# Write down the confidence interval.
#-0.5432962 to  0.6980481
# Write an interpretation of your confidence interval.
# We are 91.4 percent confident that the value is between  -0.5432962 and 0.6980481
# We are interested in whether there is evidence that there is specific value difference between the PLAN scores for the two years. (See PDF for more specifics.)
# Is there evidence this is true?
# No
# Reason why or why not.
# 0 lies in the CI, thus there is no evidence of difference of the means.
## Task 11: Create a confidence interval for the variance of Graduation Rate. (See PDF for CI to create.) Ignore any warnings generated.
# Code:
library(EnvStats)
varTest(gr,
alternative = "two.sided",
conf.level = 0.942)
# Copy and paste results here
#Chi-Squared Test on Variance
#data:  graduation_rate
#Chi-Squared = 22797, df = 77, p-value < 2.2e-16
#alternative hypothesis: true variance is not equal to 1
#94.2 percent confidence interval:
#223.0797 412.5564
#sample estimates:
#variance
#296.0686
# State the parameter the confidence interval is for.
#variance
# Write down the confidence interval.
# 223.0797 to 412.5564
# Write an interpretation of your confidence interval.
# We are 94.2 percent sure that the value lies between 223.0797 and 412.5564
# What assumption did we need to make to construct this confidence interval?
#Assume that the population is approximately normal
# Do you think that this assumption was met? You should reference an earlier Task from this project to answer this question.
#Yes, the histogram for the graduation rate was approximately normal
## Task 12: Hypothesis Test for Students Passing Algebra
# What conditions must you satisfy to perform this test? Do you think they are met?  Why or why not?
# The population must be approximately normal and variance must be unknown for population.
# State the hypotheses:
#H0: mu = 50
#H1: mu < 50
# Code
t.test(spa, mu = 50,
alternative = "less",
conf.level = 1-0.024)
# Copy and paste results here
#data:  students_passing_algebra
#t = 1.7356, df = 129, p-value = 0.9575
#alternative hypothesis: true mean is less than 50
#97.6 percent confidence interval:
# -Inf 58.23372
#sample estimates:
# mean of x
#53.82923
# State the Test Statistic Value: 1.7356
# State the P-Value: 0.9575
# Decision from P-Value (see PDF for significance level): Failed to reject Null hypothesis
# Conclusion from P-Value: Not enough evidence
# State the critical value. Provide your code and results.
qt(0.024, 129, lower.tail = TRUE)
#-1.996361
# State the critical region.
#Reject Null Hypothesis if t < -1.996
#Since t = 1.7356 > -1.9963.
# We Do not reject the hypothesis.
# Would you make the same decision based on the critical region that you did with your p-value? Why or why not?
# Yes, values outside the rejection region will have p value higher than out significance level
