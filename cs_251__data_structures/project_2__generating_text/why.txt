I chose "The Diary of a young girl" because it portrays the life of a young girl forced to live between a war or catastrophe, and it would generate some texts that would be really interesting to read whilst be funny in a dark way. Some of the text contained funny sentences like "dog was burned" which is harsh and "bath he goes around to each of us with a schoolbag" which i find really amusing.
